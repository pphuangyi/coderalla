    "# Dam of Candies\n",
    "Geek wants to make a special space for candies on his bookshelf. Currently, it has $N$ books of different heights and unit width. Help him select $2$ books such that he can store maximum candies between them by removing all the other books from between the selected books. The task is to find out the area between $2$ books that can hold the maximum candies without changing the original position of selected books. "
